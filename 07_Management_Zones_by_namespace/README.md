# Exercise #7 Create Management Zones by namespace

## Create Management Zones

In a similar manner than the [previous exercise](../06_Management_Zones_by_application), create additional Management Zones to distinguish the different namespaces of the Sock Shop application.

- <b>Hint #1</b> : Namespaces are Kubernetes properties captured automatically by Dynatrace
- <b>Hint #2</b> : Your Management Zones will need 2 conditions
- <b>Hint #3</b> : You need to define 2 Management Zones

Solution is available [here](./07_1_07_1_Solution).
