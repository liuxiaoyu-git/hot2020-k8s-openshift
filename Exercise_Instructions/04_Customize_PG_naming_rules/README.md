# Exercise #4 Customize Process Group naming rules for Kubernetes

## Explore auto-detected Process and Process Group names

Take a quick look at the current <b>Process</b> and <b>Process Group</b> naming as automatically assigned by Dynatrace with the built-in naming rules.

You can see processes and process groups in different locations in the Dynatrace console:

- <b>Technologies</b> view : <b>Process Groups</b> by underlying technology
- <b>Hosts</b> view : processes monitored on a <b>Host</b> (Kubernetes node)
- <b>Transactions & Services</b> view : for a given <B>Service</b>, the infographic shows the <b>Process Group Instances</b> implementing the <b>Service</b>
- <b>Smartscape</b>

## Configure custom Process Group naming rules

What we want to achieve is having process groups showing up with naming that tells us:

- Whether the process runs in Kubernetes or not. Let's have the Process Group name start with `k8s` for those in Kubernetes.
- What project is the process (container) part of. Your company likely has multiple projects running in the same cluster.
- The process/container/pod namespace, which in our case with Sock Shop also tells us if it's production or dev.
- The container name, which correspond to our microservice name

Target Process Group naming convention :  `k8s-project-namespace-container`
  
Let's apply that configuration in Dynatrace!

- Go in <i>Settings -> Processes and containers -> Process group naming rules</i> and click <b>Add a new rule</b>
- Provide a name to the rule, for example : `Kubernetes Project.Namespace.Container`
- First, we want this rule to apply only to containerized processes running in Kubernetes. This is done by defining a condition.
  - In the <b>Conditions</b> drop-down, select the property `"Kubernetes namespace"` and the condition `"exists"`
- For the name format, we can enter free text and/or use placeholders.
  - Placeholders are in between brackets {} to distinguish them from free text
  - Enter this format : 
    - `k8s-{ProcessGroup:Kubernetes:pipeline.project}.{ProcessGroup:KubernetesNamespace}.{ProcessGroup:KubernetesContainerName}`

### Preview 

Before saving a rule that will affect the way information is displayed to all Dynatrace users, you would probably like to have a glance at the potential result. 

This is possible! :grinning:

- Click the <b>Preview</b> button
  - The left column shows the current auto-detected <b>Process Group</b> names as assigned by built-in rules
  - The right column shows the new names resulting from the application of the custom rule you defined

- <u>DON'T FORGET</u> to click <b>Create rule</b> then <b>Save changes</b> (bottom right button) !!!

## Validate

Navigate to <b>Technologies</b>, <b>Hosts</b> and <b>Transactions & Services</b> views to look at the applied custom <b>Process group naming rule.

It might take a minute or two for all processes to show up with the new names. If the naming doesn't change, it's probably that you forgot to save the rule... You will have to repeat the previous steps to create it again. :unamused:
